### Cloning
(I'm not sure what other cloning instructions are required. Here is what I know to do.)
- Click clone and copy clone url from Github.
- In Terminal: 
    - $ git clone clone-url new-project-name // clone repo to new repo on your computer
    - $ rm -rf .git && git init // remove old git commits and reinitialize a new git project
    - $ npm install // install dependencies
- Be sure to update the env.local file with your own API_KEY.
